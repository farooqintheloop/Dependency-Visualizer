- **Use a consistent mouse speed**: Not too fast, not too slow
- **Highlight important interactions**: Hover effects, clicks
- **Show the "wow moment"**: The graph appearing and vulnerability detection
- **End with a clear result**: Leave the final state visible for 2-3 seconds

1. Open dependency-visualizer.vercel.app
2. Click "Try Example Project" button
3. Wait for analysis to complete
4. Show the beautiful dependency graph
5. Click on a red/orange vulnerable node
